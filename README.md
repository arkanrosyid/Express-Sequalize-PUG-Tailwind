# Express MVC with Sequelize, Pug, and Tailwind CSS

This is a sample project demonstrating how to build an Express.js application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture with Sequelize for database interactions, Pug as the templating engine, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Organized project structure following the MVC pattern.
- **Sequelize ORM**: Manage database operations with Sequelize.
- **Pug Templating**: Render dynamic HTML with Pug.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilize Tailwind for modern, responsive styling.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

## Project Structure

```
/controllers     # Controllers handling business logic
/models          # Sequelize models and associations
/routes          # Application routes
/views           # Pug templates
/public          # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
/utils           # Error handling files
/middlewares      # Middleware file
```

## Usage

- **routes**: Define application routes in the `routes` directory.
- **controllers**: Implement business logic and handle requests in the `controllers` directory.
- **models**: Define database schemas and interactions in the `models` directory.
