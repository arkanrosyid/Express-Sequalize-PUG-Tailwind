# 🚀 Express MVC Boilerplate with Sequelize, Pug & Tailwind CSS

A modern, modular Express.js starter project showcasing the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture. It integrates **Sequelize** for ORM-based database operations, **Pug** for dynamic templating, and **Tailwind CSS** for sleek and responsive styling.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧱 **MVC Architecture** – Cleanly separates concerns with controllers, models, and views
- 🔄 **Sequelize ORM** – Simplifies database interaction with powerful query features
- 🖼️ **Pug Templating** – Lightweight and readable syntax for rendering views
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A relational database (e.g., **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**)

## 🗂️ Project Structure
```
/controllers     # Business logic and controller methods
/models          # Sequelize models and relationships
/routes          # Route definitions for the app
/views           # Pug templates for server-side rendering
/public          # Static assets like CSS, JS, and images
/utils           # Utility functions and error handlers
/middlewares     # Custom middleware (auth, error, logging, etc.)
```

## 🚀 How to Use
- Define application routes in the **`routes/`** directory
- Handle logic and DB interaction in **`controllers/`**
- Design your data models and relationships in **`models/`**
- Build your UI using **Pug** in **`views/`**, styled with **Tailwind**
- Add reusable middleware in **`middlewares/`**
